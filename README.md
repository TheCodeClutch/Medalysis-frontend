Medalysis is an API that serves its purpose solely towards tracking locations, figuring out patterns of symptoms, and helping one observe the growing trends of diseases and epidemics worldwide, thus identify an incoming pandemic at an early stage.

# What it does

1. The portal revolves around enabling doctors/nurses/hospital personnel to post relevant data of each of their patients regularly and anonymously thus preserving privacy and avoiding leakage of sensitive data. This data is usually to help identify common trends of diseases such as symptoms, organs affected, age of the patient, etc.
2. In order to make sure that no one but official doctors/hospital staff are posting, we let them enter an ID specifically to be used on the portal known as the "Medalysis ID", in-turn generated by entering their Practioner IDs and National IDs. This is to ensure that the whole data of the portal is reliable and trustworthy.
3. The Doctor's data shall be stored on the Medalysis Database by Government Officials for enabling a seamless process and authorize the doctors to use the application.
4. Once the patient data is being fed on the database, we can categorically filter out the data pertaining to various attributes such as symptoms, organs affected, severity, age range, gender, country, and year of occurrence
5. This filtered data is then visualized on a marked world map, thus helping the observer identify the worldwide population patterns and trends of affected patients in general, based on the specific applied categories.


# How does Medalysis serves different stakeholders

We are immensely proud that our API will be serving an enormous number of stakeholders, in many different ways: 
1. Data Scientists - They can gain insights and perform statistical analysis on various patterns of illness and come up with accurate data for further research.
2. Travelers and Travel Agencies - Travellers can be made aware and cautioned by travel websites, flight booking sites, and agencies about the ongoing sickness cases in particular areas overtime, thus alerting them to avoid planning trips around those areas.
3. Doctors - Doctors can note down the condition of patients in and around areas, thus they'll immediately come to know once a particular pattern of illness follows, thus becoming alert immediately about a possible occurrence of epidemic/pandemic, and taking appropriate actions.
4. Governments - Country government can be in the loop about the health conditions and prevailing diseases of the citizens residing in that nation at any point in time.
5. Pharmaceutical companies - This precious data can be sold to pharmaceutical companies and help them gain insight into their future production scope after analyzing the database, thus helping them in reaching new heights in business.
6. Technical Developers - Integrating our API can help developers build applications that require such sort of detailed worldwide statistical data in their endeavors.

# How we built it

1. The website frontend was made using HTML, CSS, and JS.
2. The website backend was made using Node JS and MongoDB as the database. The backend is deployed on Heroku and is up and live at https://medalysis.herokuapp.com
3. We integrated the HERE Maps API in the frontend to pick out the exact locations for developing the trends of the illnesses.

Working with a postman required some heavy behind the scenes understanding and documenting the backend.
Here's the workflow of how we worked on a public postman workspace as follows:-

1. After creating a workspace, and forming a team we created two collections namely production endpoints and mock examples.
2. We then created two environments for both the collections.
3. Up next, we divided both the collections into four folders namely Government, Doctors, Developers, and Open
4. For each and every GET and POST request, we configured environment variables, wrote test scripts, and also configured the parameters, headers, and body content as per the requirements of each request.
5. Mock examples were created from production environment requests in order to make the Mock server run properly. Then we integrated the monitoring production environment and scheduled weekly tests.
6. Lastly, we documented production endpoint collections as the end of the process.
